I am passionate about make life better through technology. I cared about this from very early on. My family reminds me on every occation how I force everybody to play "playmobil" with me, after I got it when I was five years old. And there was always one common theme: "I was a scientist that fixed all the world problems through technology". It was also a way to handle the experiences I made. Like one time someone was sick and I would not accept in my world that this could not be fixed by technology. Or that people would have to work so hard and in dangerous jobs. In my world jobs and industry where completely automated. This small boy believed that he could fix the bad in the world through technology. And he would not be stop by anything or anybody, he is a pirate scientist, that get things done.

Then I grew up and other things came into my mind and reality caught up with me, I studied business administration and computer science. But even back in university I was attracted to the startup scene, even when it wasn't so hip at the time. I knew creating something was one of my dreams. Then I went to work for a big IT company that share this vision. Now I am strait on the way to age 30 and asked the question: What is the goal of my life?

It took weeks and month because I had forgotten about the dreams of this five years old boy, but finally I remembered. So my passion today is on smart technology solutions in industry and health care that make life better. My hope is that one day I will have contributed a small part to make the dreams of this 5 years old boy more of an reality. To do this I am interested in the following areas:
<ol>
<li>Application Development: Microservice, Java, Javascript, Software Design ... </li>	
<li>Connect: Microservices, SOA, ESB, Connectivity (MQTT), Sensors and Actuators</li>
<li>Analyses: Apache Storm, Apache Spark, Data Analytics (Python)</li>
<li>Actionalize: Rules & Machine Learning</li>
<li>Autonomize: Semantics like RDF, SPARQL, IBM Watson</li>
</ol>

Besides following this dream I want to have fun, be healthy and happy. Currently I love to play Hearthstone and Pillers of Eternity for the fun part. I like to work out, swim, go for a walk, go hiking, enjoy nature for balance. All this I like to do together, so contact me, maybe we can do something together or join a something like a meetup.
