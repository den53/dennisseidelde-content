First of all thank you to for checking this page and by this help me paying it forward to wonderful people I am grateful to for the rest of my life. We all know the world has become a fast, inpersonal and "economic" place. And in 2014 I entered professional life completely as a consultant. After 6 month, it is Christmas time, I am sitting here and reflect on this and I like my job to solve problems even when it means to work hard. And I wonder why this is? Why does it feel so easy? And then I realised how many people help me, when I needed it, and that you have made it so easy for me to grow. But while I am sitting here at the table I realised that because of the fast pace I never appreciate what you done for me. And this pains me, because you deserve better. So I pick up the keyboard and wrote this down. And then asked myself should I share this what about the people that I will not write down, what about the order ... but you deserve to know. Everybody deserves to know what great persons you are and when they are grateful to me they are grateful to you fore shaping me into the person I am today.

So this is not a scoreboard and has no order and is  not up to date because life is still fast. <strong>This is a sign to you that I appreciate help and remember</strong>. Even when I won't find the time to update this page,  I remember what you have done for me every time we shake hands or somebody thanks me because you made this way. Thank you and will pay this forward by doing everything I can to grow into the great, helping and caring persons you already are. Thank you!

My mom, my dad, my brother Jannik and my sisters Anja and Ela. You did so much for me,  you where always there for me!
