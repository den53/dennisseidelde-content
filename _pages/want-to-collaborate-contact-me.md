<h4>Do you have an idea? Do you have a question? Or do you looking for help? I’d love to learn and share!</h4>

I’m an IBMer and “Mentorship” and “Helping” is at the core of our culture. Therefore one of my of my priorities for this year is to share what I’m learning with more people. On this blog I reflect on what I’ve learned, write blog posts, and create presentations and podcasts. Additionally I’m looking for people who want to learn what I’ve learned (and am learning), braindump ideas in response to their questions.

[blockquote author="" link="" style="" target="_blank"]Colaborating with each other is great because:
<ul>
	<li>We find new perspectives we would no thought of alone</li>
	<li>We focus on what’s valuable to people</li>
	<li>We can reach more people</li>
	<li>We can make the world work better[/blockquote]</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h4>Topics that I’m interst in right now, but the best things come are unplaned, so I also love to collaborate on new things:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Building Smart Applications: Microservices, Java, JavaScript, Spring Boot, AngularJS, Bluemix</li>
	<li>Challenges and Chances in die Manufacturing Domain</li>
	<li>Challenges and Chances in die Healthcare Domain</li>
        <li>IoT & Analytics</li>
	<li>Connecting and networking, particularly as an introvert</li>
	<li>Figuring life out, finding and following your passion</li>
	<li>4 hour work week</li>
</ol>
<h4>How it might work:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Drop me a question or contact me with an short introduction and what you’re interested in. I prefer to communicate through my blog, social networks (<a href="http://de.linkedin.com/in/dennisseidel/">linkedin</a>) or <a href="mailto:mail@dennisseidel.de">e-mail</a> (with linkedin preferred the most).</li>
	<li>We can set up a 20-minute or 50-minute call and chat about what’s on your mind.</li>
	<li>If it turns out we’ve got lots to talk about and we mesh well together, let’s set up recurring calls and have an ongoing conversation. If lots of people have similar questions, it would be interesting to set up group conferences or a community so that we can all learn from each other.</li>
</ol>
So, how can I help you or someone you know?
