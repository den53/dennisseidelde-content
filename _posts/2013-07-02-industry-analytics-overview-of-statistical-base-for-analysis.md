Statistics is the base for analysis you can be confident in your analytic results. This includes a wide range of procedures and tests to solve your business and research challenges.

Descriptive statistics is the discipline of quantitatively describing the main features of a collection of data.

[1] Descriptive statistics are distinguished from inferential statistics (or inductive statistics), in that descriptive statistics aim to summarize a data set, rather than use the data to learn about the population that the data are thought to represent. This generally means that descriptive statistics, unlike inferential statistics, are not developed on the basis of probability theory.

[2] Even when a data analysis draws its main conclusions using inferential statistics, descriptive statistics are generally also presented. For example in a paper reporting on a study involving human subjects, there typically appears a table giving the overall sample size, sample sizes in important subgroups (e.g., for each treatment or exposure group), and demographic or clinical characteristics such as the average age, the proportion of subjects of each sex, and the proportion of subjects with related comorbidities.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Descriptive Statistics:</span></strong>

<strong>Crosstabulations</strong> - Counts, percentages, residuals, marginals, tests of independence, tests of linear association, measure of linear association, ordinal data measures, nominal by interval measures, measure of agreement, relative risk estimates for case control and cohort studies.

<strong>Frequencies</strong> - Counts, percentages, valid and cumulative percentages; central tendency, dispersion, distribution and percentile values.

<strong>Descriptives</strong> - Central tendency, dispersion, distribution and Z scores.

<strong>Descriptive ratio statistics</strong> - Coefficient of dispersion, coefficient of variation, price-related differential and average absolute deviance.

<strong>Compare means</strong> - Choose whether to use harmonic or geometric means; test linearity; compare via independent sample statistics, paired sample statistics or one-sample t test.

<strong>ANOVA and ANCOVA</strong> - Conduct contrast, range and post hoc tests; analyze fixed-effects and random-effects measures; group descriptive statistics; choose your model based on four types of the sum-of-squares procedure; perform lack-of-fit tests; choose balanced or unbalanced design; and analyze covariance with up to 10 methods.

<strong>Correlation</strong> - Test for bivariate or partial correlation, or for distances indicating similarity or dissimilarity between measures.

<strong>Nonparametric tests</strong> - Chi-square, Binomial, Runs, one-sample, two independent samples, k-independent samples, two related samples, k-related samples.

<strong>Explore</strong> - Confidence intervals for means; M-estimators; identification of outliers; plotting of findings.
