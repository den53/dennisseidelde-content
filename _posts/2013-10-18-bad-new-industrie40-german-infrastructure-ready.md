The Internet becomes globally faster and we in Germany have increased as well. This was reported in a recently publication by the Akamai "the State of the Internet" report. However, we are not grown in comparison to other nations so quickly. Germany was in April, on place 19 with 6.0 Mbit / s on average, we are now only number 22 in comparison with 7.3 Mbit / s onÂ  average.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/87252094@N07/10348610635/" title="20131018-internetaccess-world-comparison von sinnesabenteurer bei Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7407/10348610635_c7ffc772a2_o.jpg" width="590" height="420" alt="20131018-internetaccess-world-comparison"></a>

Leader still remains South Korea, followed by Japan. Our neighbor Switzerland jumped from 5th to 3rd place - from 8.7 Mbit / s on average to 11 Mbit / s and the Netherlands (10.1 Mbit / s), Czech Republic (9.8 Mbit / s) and Latvia (10.6 Mbit / s) are faster. To blame for the slow german data connection remains the slow progressive development of broadband networks. Based on the facts Germany can not be expected to catch up in the foreseeable future to the digital world.

This is bad news for Industrie 4.0 as it heavily relies on the improvement of the broadband infrastructure.
