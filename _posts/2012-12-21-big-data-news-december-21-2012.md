<p>Today, the Nevada Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED) and Desert Research Institute (DRI) announced they are partnering with IBM to use the PureSystems family of expert integrated systems for big data analytics and advanced research applications in the state’s higher education system. This will serve as a basis for a new public and private sector collaboration that will drive overall workforce and economic development across the state.</p></div></div></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ibm-big-data-hub/~4/s4spXur_Ba0" height="1" width="1" /></div>

<div><div><div><div><p>Earlier this week, IBM unveiled its yearly "<a href="http://ibm.co/UdNtY9" target="_blank">5 in 5</a>" list - five predictions that forward-thinkers expect will come to be within five years. This year's list envisions computers that will literally "touch" us, as well as see, hear, taste and smell. As <a href="http://bit.ly/UdNOKe" target="_blank"><em>Popular Science</em></a> put it, "<span>Siri suddenly seems quaint by comparison."</span></p>
<p><span>Since the five-year view is taken, I turned attention much closer, asking several regular Big Data Hub contributors for their prognostications of what will happen in the world of big data in 2013.</span></p>

<div><p><span>Yesterday, there was a meetup in Arlington on Political Campaign Data Science with a panel of four experts to talk about their work. As we have all heard, the 2012 Presidential election was steeped in data like never before, with the Obama campaign in particular using advanced analytical methods to target voters, and with Nate Silver and other polling aggregators providing fascinating insights int</span><span>o the dynamics of the campaign.
