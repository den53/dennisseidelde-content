<strong>This section I use for my weekly review. </strong>This is where I celebrate what I accomplished and get a heads-up on what’s next. This I do every Sunday.

<strong>I use the weekly review to make sure I spend time on things that I want to do.</strong> It’s easy to forget that in the endless ping-pong game of responding to other people’s requests, or to scatter your attention among lots of interests and not feel like you’re making progress in any particular one. Give yourself permission to work on something you want to do, and carve out space for it in your to-do list or calendar. I divide my to-do list into three categories: work, social, and personal. The work category is easy to fill. Social take a little more thought, but other people make it easy by asking. Life, on the other hand—the skills I want to develop, the hobbies I want to explore—that requires me to step up and <em>choose</em> to do something instead of having my time filled by things that other people have chosen for me.

<strong>Lots of things are interesting, but I try to pick one or two things to focus on during each week.</strong> For example, I’ve been focusing on having a date on saturday and studying Big Data Technology. I might explore other ideas during the week, but it’s good to make slow and steady progress in my focus areas.

<strong>I make that space by managing my commitments. </strong>It’s easy to get used to a hectic, time-starved status quo, and it’s gratifying as well—busy-ness helps you feel valued. For me, “normal life” includes time to breathe and time to play. I avoid being <em>busy. W</em>hen I notice I’m starting to make mistakes because my calendar is too full, I slow down and see what I can say no to.

<strong>I add “want-to”s to my to-do list instead of just keeping it to the “must-do”s,</strong>and I remove or change other tasks until things look like they’ll fit. It makes reviewing and planning more fun, and it gives me something to look forward to during the week.

Might be something that can help you establish that habit. =) Happy to hear your thoughts and to read your weekly reviews!

This idea and system are inspired, adapted and modified with highest regards from <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/05/use-the-weekly-review-to-give-yourself-permission-to-do-things-you-want-to-do/?shareadraft=baba24781_518acf034b036">sacha</a>.

A weekly review is an excellent idea. Here are some of the reasons why I do it:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Track and celebrate accomplishments. </strong>Ever wondered where your days went? Tracking your accomplishments lets you get a handle on what you’ve done. Celebrating what you’ve finished encourages you to do more, too.</li>
	<li><strong>Deliberately plan the next week.</strong> Instead of just reacting to the tasks and interruptions that come up during the week, sit down and plan a few things that <em>you</em> want to do.</li>
	<li><strong>Follow up on priorities.</strong> If a priority task needs more work, having it on your list makes it easy to follow up (or see where you’re procrastinating!).</li>
	<li><strong>Keep people up to date. </strong>If you make it easy for family, friends, and coworkers to keep up with what you’re doing, they’ll know more about interests, resources and opportunities that can help you.</li>
	<li><strong>Make it easy to review the year.</strong> Having a record of your accomplishments and tasks makes those yearly reviews so much easier.</li>
	<li><strong>Reflect on what worked and what can be better.</strong> Reviewing your week and planning the next one nudges you to think about how things can be better.</li>
</ol>
It doesn’t take a lot of time, and the benefits are tremendous. I can usually do my weekly review in 15-30 minutes.

Here’s what I’ve learned from doing so:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Bullet lists keep things short and simple.</strong> You don’t need to document everything – just enough to help you remember.</li>
	<li><strong>Categories help you keep things balanced. </strong>There are lots of different category systems you can use, and you can make up your own. <em>7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em> recommends thinking in terms of your different roles. <em>Getting Things Done</em> has lots of good pointers for weekly reviews. Play around with the idea.</li>
	<li><strong>There are lots of ways to do a weekly review, so experiment to find what works for you.</strong> Some people like asking a set of questions instead. Others like using spreadsheets. Find out what works for you!</li>
</ul>
If you’re new to blogging, a weekly review helps you ease into the habit of publishing, and it can help you improve your productivity habits too. Give it a try!
