<p>Daily Scrum 27. Nov 2015</p>

<p>What did I do since the last daily scrum?
- I went to the Stabi in Munich and got my identity card, and learn that there is no free wifi unless you are a student
- I found potential good wifi places (Stadtbib Munich, DB Lounge)</p>

<p>What will I have done until the next daily scrum (Biggest Frog Task)?
- I will workout, towards my goal of being healthy and in good shape. 
- I will go to the Stadtbib bring my grilfriends books back, check the wifi and work (do my coursera course) until they close at 16:00.</p>

<p>What interfered with my work?</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>Days to Deadline and what happens when doing nothing about this today:
- 5 days until developer's guide review</p>
