Tom Davenport, Research Director of the International Institute for Analytics, Visiting Professor at Harvard Business School and Senior Advisor to Deloitte Analytics, writes in the Wall Street Journal Blog that companies seek an integrated rather than siloed approach to Big Data:

<em>We studied the Big Data activities of large, well-established businesses—companies like United Parcel Service Inc. , Wells Fargo &amp; Co., United Healthcare Products Inc., and other giants. All are doing something with Big Data, but large volume, high velocity, and unstructured data in those organizations must be integrated with everything else that’s going on in the company. Overall, we found the expected co-existence; in not a single one of these large organizations was Big Data being managed separately from other types of data and analytics—it’s all blended together.</em>

He goes on to describe Big Data as a paradigm shift, and emphasises the transition organisations will need to make:

<em>Even though it hasn’t been long since the advent of Big Data—a decade or so for online firms, and less for big companies in other industries—these attributes add up to a new era. Some aspects of this new world will no doubt continue to emerge, but organizations need to begin transitioning now to the new integration of big and small data. The new model means change in skills, leadership, organizational structures, technologies, and architectures. Together they comprise the most sweeping change in what we do to get value from data since the 1980s.</em>
