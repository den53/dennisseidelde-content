<p>In the last years and month I kept my eye on the areas of Industrie 4.0 or Industrial Internet. While I will continue this journey, and will refocus more on the area around lifestyle and healthcare and consumer products. Why?</p>

<p>I definitely believe that there is large potential in Industrie 4.0, I personally am quite surprised with the experience how long it takes until an idea makes it to pilot or even production in the enterprise it. In the consumer area the cycle times are much lower.</p>

<p>But there are two more important reasons. First I enjoy helping people, and when I thought about my dream when I was a little boy, I dreamed to help people make the world a better place by making them more happy and helping them to be healthy. Well back then I dream of healing every diseases and fixing all the world problems form climate change to mass hunger. Most likely this will stay a dream, but I love the idea to contribute a small small piece to something meaningful.</p>

<p>I always believe I could do something meaningful, and this does not mean to revolutionise the world, only few of us are luck enough to experience this. But do something meaningful means to putting your head to a meaningful challenge and throwing punches to wear down the challenge for a heavy hitter to punch it out.</p>

<blockquote>But do something meaningful means to putting your head to a meaningful challenge and throwing punches to wear down the challenge for a heavy hitter to punch it out.</blockquote>

<p>So we come to the third reason: I am currently working at IBM, and one reasons I chose to work for IBM was that they brand themselves as a company that contributes something meaningful the the solutions of large problems. Currently I integrate systems at big banks, while this is important, it seams quite meaningless compared to curing cancer or alzheimer's or any other disease. But as it seems we IBM has not given up on making meaningful contributions. When they announced in April 2015 that "healthcare will be our moonshot", I knew that I have to be a part of this. Therefore I will refocus on this area, and learn what is important about this topic and how it can be combined with the Internet of Things. I see a large overlap between Industrie 4.0 and the consumer side. I think we will get a much larger acceptance for Industrie 4.0 to be not just another buzzword, when we focus on the customer and identify areas where we can generate immediate benefit to the people.</p>

<p>What this will mean for my focus areas, well I will have to keep learning to develop and maintain apps on a cloud platform. This includes connecting things to the cloud with Arduino &amp; Node.JS. Those Applications will follow a modern agile Microservice architecture. But modern application need also some analytics to generate value from data. To do this I will useApache Spark, Java, Python, R and Statistics.</p>

<p>This will be continued!</p>
