The analysts forecast the <strong>Global Industrial Automation Control market to grow at a CAGR of 6.87 percent</strong> over the period 2013-2018. One of the <strong>key factors contributing to this market growth is the increasing demand for automation control systems from the Oil and Gas industry</strong>. The Global Industrial Automation Control market has also been <strong>witnessing the increased availability of wireless sensor networking solutions</strong>. However, the <strong>reluctance among end-users to migrate to the latest technology could pose a challenge to the growth of this market</strong>.

Key vendors dominating this space include ABB Ltd., Honeywell International Inc., Rockwell Automation Inc., and Siemens AG.

Other vendors mentioned in the report are Applied Material Inc., Apriso Corp., Aspen Technologies Inc., Camstar Systems Inc., Control Systems International Inc., Emerson Electric Co., Eyelite Inc., GE Co., Invensys plc., Metso Corp., Miracom Inc., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Omron Corp., SAP AG, Schneider Electric SA, Toshiba International Corp., Werum Software &amp; Systems AG, and Yokogawa Electric Corp.

Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: The <strong>increased availability of wireless sensor networking solutions in SCADA-based industrial control systems is one of the major emerging trends</strong> witnessed in the Global Industrial Automation Control market in recent years. Wireless sensor networking systems help enterprises o<strong>vercome certain issues related to the rigid architecture of SCADA</strong> such as inflexibility and centralized architecture. With this technology, deployment of sensors in SCADA-based industrial control systems becomes easier as it provides wireless networking access. For instance, in the Energy and Power industry, sensors are generally deployed in either production or induction wells. Through wireless sensor technology, the sensors can be deployed inside gas pipelines in a cost-effective manner, thereby resulting in enhanced process efficiency of the plants.

According to the report, one of the major drivers in this market is the increasing <strong>demand for automation control systems from the Oil and Gas industry</strong>. Effective deployment of automation solutions helps companies <strong>improve their productivity and enhance their monitoring and security systems</strong>.
