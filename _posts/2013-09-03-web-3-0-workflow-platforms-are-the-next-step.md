<!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?--> <span style="font-size: 17px;">When people hear about Web 2.0 they think about Facebook, Twitter or Google. Well Facebook is now over 10 years old, let's take a look what is next. Is there a Web 3.0?</span>
<div style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 17px;"><span style="line-height: 25px; text-align: justify;">Web 2.0 was about people and systems being able to communicate across multiple platforms. Now people taking about the semantic web as the next step. But being able to take one object, and pass it through multiple services to accomplish a task is that critical evolutionary step before “The Semantic Web” becomes meaningful.</span></span></div>
<p style="font-family: Tahoma, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 17px;">In order to take advantage of this evolution, you are going to need a way to manage your processes across multiple services. Over time, more and more products will emerge that integrate multiple services. However, waiting for these services to evolve into the fully integrated service solutions will put you behind the game.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: Tahoma, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 17px;">Workflow platforms provide a way to not only create integrated service products, but also to manage business process in an organization across multiple systems, services, databases, apps, etc. Workflow software is that bridge that allows for one object to be taken to multiple islands of service and data and returned as a completed task. </span></p>
