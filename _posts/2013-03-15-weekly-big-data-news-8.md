<div><div><div><div><p>Nuances in the user experience (UX) impact the overall level of customer satisfaction and loyalty. Ask the restaurant chain that avoided losing clientele by changing the ketchup, or the airline carrier that doesn't charge for checked bags, or the car manufacturer whose cars tell drivers about the nearest garage. Hyoun Park, Principal Analyst of Nucleus Research, joined us in our recent <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23CXO" target="_blank">#CXO chat</a> as we explored refining the UX with big data. Here are some nuggets from that conversation.</p>

<div><div><div><div><p>Big data is not a religion. Rather, it’s an analytics paradigm that enables business outcomes beyond what can normally be achieved at lower volumes, velocities and/or varieties of data.</p>
<p>Scale is everything. Big data means many things to many people, but at heart most of us agree that the “3 Vs” of extreme scale—petabyte volumes, real-time velocities and multistructured varieties—describe the paradigm’s core focus. To justify your investment in big-data technologies, you must have a clear sense for which analytical use cases can best achieve their objectives at greater scale.</p></div></div></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ibm-big-data-hub/~4/pg9C3TkuaZg" height="1" width="1" /></div>

<div><p align="center"><span>2.7 zetabytes of data exist in the digital universe today according to recent IBM case studies. Yes, you heard right. I said zetabytes; 10^21 bytes or 1,000x larger than an exabyte (which itself is a billion times larger than a gigabyte). From a visual perspective, if the cup of coffee on your desk was equivalent to one gigabyte, a zetabyte would have the same volume as the Great Wall of China. Now multiply that number…</span></p></div>
