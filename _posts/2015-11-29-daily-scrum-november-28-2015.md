<p>Daily Scrum 28. Nov 2015</p>

<p>What did I do since the last daily scrum?
- Went working out
- Went to the Stadtbibliothek MÃ¼nchen (free wifi, nice place to be) and started with my java lessons</p>

<p>What will I have done until the next daily scrum (Biggest Frog Task)?
- I will finish this weeks lesson on Java.
- I will finish up the writing part on the developers guide. 
- I will watch Breaking Bead with H.</p>

<p>What interfered with my work? 
- The wifi connect in this places is not made to be used for streaming, therefore bring the videos and the task next time with you.</p>

<p>Days to Deadline and what happens when doing nothing about this today:
- 4 days to Review of Developers Guide</p>
