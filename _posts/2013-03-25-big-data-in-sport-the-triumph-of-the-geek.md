Back in Highschool everyone wanted to be a quarterback or on the sports team. And the sport guys were the cool kids and everybody was proud about the possibility of becoming a Pro athlete. This was yesterday, today this changes. In the long run big data will be the essential part. As you can read below in the field of baseball, this is happening right now, and soccer will be tomorrow.
I work at IBM with Big Data Technology everyday, and see how this technology changes the world. In the future the technology that helps companies to find hidden pattern in petabytes of data. If your daughter is pregnant Wal-Mart will probably know it before you and even your daughter by analysing and correlation shopping patterns. Now think about correlating speed, weight, power, blood, genetic, social and much more data. You probably know the athlete better than himself. You can find the optimal Player, and train and develop him in an optimal way. Clearly this means in the future guys who now data will be the ones that create world class player unseen before.

In the future you can expect more big data post on big data and soccer.

<blockquote>Data geeks revolutionized baseball, as described in Michael Lewis' Moneyball. Now big data is going to revolutionize it even more. A company called Sportvision has developed FIELDf/x, a means to digitally track and record the position of all players and every hit ball in real time. By pairing live camera feeds with object recognition and tracking abilities, then feeding its observations to computers, FIELDf/x is able to pull objective, quantitative data from the game. Baseball generates an astounding number of statistics. How many times does a batter get on base? How many runs does he score per game? How many hits does a pitcher give up while on the mound? The list goes on and on and only gets more specific and specialized. All these numbers are crunched to help coaches and managers determine the best way to set a game's lineup or figure out what kind of pitch is most likely to be successful against a hitter. And now FIELDf/x is set up to help capture even more data. For the first time in the 150 years that baseball statistics have been kept, ball clubs will be able to objectively measure how quickly players react to the ball, how quickly they throw it while fielding, and even keep track of where it goes. Using this method to capture stats for one game of baseball will generate roughly two terabytes of data (2,048 GB). This is huge, but FIELDf/x is able to organize it and derive value from it. It's a brilliant aid to team owners, coaches and managers. This system will create data that will change how up-and-coming players are scouted and how current players are valued. Ideally, this translates into more wins. The only people it seems like it will hurt are overvalued players and the coaches who display irrational cognitive bias toward them.</blockquote>
