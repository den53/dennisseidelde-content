An intersting Start Up in the Big Data Prediction field.

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Accurate predictions have been a tantalizing prize since the days of the soothsayers, but these days the business is getting more technical, from collaboration-centric <a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/10/19/can-watching-twitter-trends-help-predict-the-future/" target="_blank">financial forecasting </a>techniques to <a href="http://gigaom.com/data/why-nate-silver-and-others-predicted-the-election-perfectly/" target="_blank">Nate Silver’s data-driven political predictions </a><strong id="speechFragmentSeparator__1_2">.</strong> Of course, those two examples are pretty different, but an Austrian firm called <a href="https://www.prediki.com/" target="_blank">Prediki </a>is now trying to come up with a tool for general-purpose predictions<strong id="speechFragmentSeparator__1_3">.</strong></p>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;"></div>
<div id="post-content-589757" style="padding-left: 30px;">
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It’s still all relatively stealthy – that link above won’t tell you much – but the company has nonetheless announced $650k in seed financing from the Austrian government-funded Federal Promotion Bank<strong id="speechFragmentSeparator__1_4">.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In a statement, CEO Hubertus Hofkirchner said Prediki’s patent-pending technology would be able to “unveil information about the future where traditional market research and opinion survey instruments have proven unreliable or inapplicable”, for clients ranging from companies to governments<strong id="speechFragmentSeparator__1_5">.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Hofkirchner has form in this business<strong id="speechFragmentSeparator__1_6">.</strong> He was formerly CEO of a company called Redmonitor, which dealt in financial predictions and sold out to <a href="http://www.cmcmarkets.com/index_en.jsp" target="_blank">CMC Markets </a>, a UK-based derivatives dealer<strong id="speechFragmentSeparator__1_7">.</strong> However, Prediki’s technology has also evolved out of systems that have been used for political polling<strong id="speechFragmentSeparator__1_8">.</strong></p>

<blockquote style="padding-left: 30px;">
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“In the past, the base technology upon which we’re building was mostly used for political forecasts,” Hofkirchner told me<strong id="speechFragmentSeparator__1_9">.</strong> “In recent times it’s probably twice as good as opinion polls for a fraction of the cost<strong id="speechFragmentSeparator__1_10">.</strong> But it was very hard in the past to apply the technology to anything else<strong id="speechFragmentSeparator__1_11">.</strong>”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“There has been lots of work done to apply the technology to things like sales forecasts, pharmaceutical approval forecasts, technology adoption, evaluating innovations, evaluating media campaigns and so on – lots of work has been done by various players in the last 10 years<strong id="speechFragmentSeparator__1_12">.</strong> But, while there has been success in the predictive performance of these things, nobody ever cracked the problem that it’s really hard to come up with a model for a truly generic all-purpose prediction market<strong id="speechFragmentSeparator__1_13">.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So does Prediki’s technology work<strong id="speechFragmentSeparator__1_14">?</strong> What am I, a fortune teller<strong id="speechFragmentSeparator__1_15">?</strong> But the Austrian government seems to have some faith in it (after all, it can apparently be used for NGOs and even governments), so let’s see<strong id="speechFragmentSeparator__1_16">.</strong> The big unveiling should take place sometime in the first quarter of next year<strong id="speechFragmentSeparator__1_17">.</strong></p>
