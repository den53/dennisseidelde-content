I restructure my knowledge management approach today. above you see a short mindmap outlining my idea. It is based on three principles SHARE, REUSE, COLLABORATE and LEARN.
<ol>
	<li>SHARE: This means when I work on a problem I share it with others and solve it together. Sharing your problems and solutions increases your reputation and at the same time reduces problem solving time. This can be done in a company social network ( at IBM this would be IBM Connections) or professional networks like quora or linkedin groups. The faster way for you to implement this is to:
<ol>
	<li>Make a list of all relevent professional social networks and groups and start interacting on them.</li>
	<li>Create a working directory in the cloud for all the documents you work currently on. A online cloud storage makes it easier to share files with your colleages and colaborates from your network. And decreases the hurdles for them to help you.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>REUSE: The key to reuse is that you have an archieve with all finished projects. And like with EMails research has show that there is no benefit of folder organization. There I advice you to find a online storage system like google docs with good search capability and ocr. This enables you to search directly in the documents instead of going through many folders.</li>
</ol>

COLLABORATE and LEARN are also important, but are more connected to the right tools and business process to utilize your previous build up REUSE and SHARE capabilities. I will attend to this topics in a post in the future.Â </em>
