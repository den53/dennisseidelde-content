<p>It is a new eara. Today programming changed radically from functionality to usablity. A customer expects to be served in milliseconds. Also the amount of data is increasing every second.&nbsp;This requires high performance programming. Internet Companies like google faced this issue ealy on. These companies developed tools and methods to overcome these challange. Many of use call this Big Data Programming.&nbsp;

Before we can understand Big Data Progamming, we need to understand why it was developed. So I recommend that you learn the basics of googles business: building a search engine. This is also a good start for everybody who never programed before. Afterware in a second post I will introduce you to state of the art Big Data Technologies that help us to use this basic principles on a large scale. Keywords are Hadoop, NoSql, Parallel Programming and a Shared Nothing Architecture.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<strong>1. Learn how to built your own search engine</strong>

Fortunatly there are great resource out there that help you in a very professional manner. I recommend to you the Python course by Udacity that is though by Sebestian Thrun a Stanford Professor and google fellow. The course is online and can be taken for free. Take a look:

Now it is your turn, sign up and <a href="http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs101/CourseRev/apr2012">learn to bulit your own search engine</a>.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

This post will be continued in the next view weeks: Big Data and Web Intelligence. And The Topics Hadoop and Parallel Programming will follow.&nbsp;
