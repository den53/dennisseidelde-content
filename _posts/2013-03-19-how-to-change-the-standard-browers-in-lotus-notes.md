<p>Today I reinstalled Lotus Notes, everything works perfect except one thing: When I click on a Link Lotus Notes opens the Link internal and not in my Google Chrome. This is how I solved it. &nbsp;

<strong>Go to the top left of Lotus Notes and open File &gt; Preferences. (Shown below)</strong>

<a href="http://www.imagebanana.com/"><img style="border: 0px;" src="http://i.imagebanana.com/img/726h0g06/MailInboxIBMLotusNotes_002.png" alt="ImageBanana - MailInboxIBMLotusNotes_002.png" /></a>

<strong>Next a windows opens: type in the field at the top (Number 1 in Screenshot) "Web" and klick on Web Browser, then select Option show in the Screenshot as Number 2. Confirm this with the "Apply" Button (Number 3 in Screenshot). &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>

You are done. Enjoy that links now will open in your choosen browers.</p>
