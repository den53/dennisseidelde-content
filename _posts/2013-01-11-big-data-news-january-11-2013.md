<div><div><div><div><p>Many organizations today are attempting to apply analytics to their customer experience initiatives. Leveraging analytics, however, means a cultural evolution in terms of how analytics are used, by whom and on what data. In a recent <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23CXO" target="_blank" title="Search for this hashtag on Twitter.com">#CXO</a> Twitter chat, Neil Raden, CEO and Principal Analyst of Hired Brains Inc, led the discussion on how to use analytics to proactively meet customer demands.</p>

<div><div><div><div><p>The artist James Turrell said “light is not so much something that reveals, as it is itself the revelation.” To take a page from Turrell’s script, I would say, “data is not the bearer of revelation – it is the revelation.” The data we have today strewn across the enterprise, when employed at the right time, in the right context, by the right individual is indeed a revelation.</p>

The scope and pace of change suggests the advent of an even more fundamental shift, focusing the broader advertising community on a series of critical questions: How can data most effectively be used to address core business needs?
