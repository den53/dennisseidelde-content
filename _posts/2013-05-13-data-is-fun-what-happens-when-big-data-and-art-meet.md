Data changes our socity and can be applied in all fields. Data is not only interesting to business. This is a video about <strong>data and art</strong>. Other intersting field I find great for <strong>data is comedy. </strong>I mean what is more hillarious than reality :-)

But now more about <strong>big data and art:</strong>

A vending machine that dispenses snacks when there is bad news is one of the creations for an art project that asks questions about what data means to society. WSJ's takes a look at how "big data" can be used to make art and social commentary. Enjoy

Do you know great facts about data or funny big data applications?
