The foundation for machines to machines communication is a common language. The Internet of Thing, Industry 4.0 or Cyber-physical systems will not be possible if machines use different languages for communication. There is a need for a common standard - Message Queuing Telemetry Transport technology(MQTT).

Five years ago, IBM has begun to speak of the "Smarter Planet", and thus referred to a world, in which technical devices and measuring devices are connected. As a major step in this part of the manufacturer sees its new product "Message Sight". "Until now, no technology able to handle this volume of messages and devices," assures Marie Wieck, general manager of IBM's Websphere middleware division.

The new integrated system is to help companies and government agencies in managing the communication with the billions of sensors that always occur in many systems and devices. Such as measuring devices are installed in more and more cars, traffic systems, oil refineries, buildings and household appliances. Especially public administrations and companies from the automotive, healthcare and financial services industries are expected to benefit from the new product according to the supplier. For example, automotive manufacturers can incorporate sensors that send messages to the control center or the dealer if certain components should be checked in their vehicles. Hospitals can monitor the use of their medical devices so that cities and manage the traffic.

Building on the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport technology, IBM MessageSight delivers the performance, value and simplicity that organizations need to accommodate the growing multitude of mobile devices and sensors. This enables large volumes of events to be processed in near real time, allowing organizations to consolidate all of the information in one place and more easily glean insights to make better business decisions.

For instance, an automotive manufacturer can use IBM MessageSight to help manage the features and services of its automobiles. With thousands of sensors in each car, a dealer can now be notified when a “check engine” light turns on in a specific car. Based on the information transmitted by the engine sensor, the dealer could then notify the owner that there is a critical problem and they should get their car serviced immediately.

“To realize the vision of a Smarter Planet, we must first enable the universe of instrumented sensors, devices and machines to communicate more efficiently while sharing, managing and integrating large volumes of data at a rate much faster than ever before,” said Bob S. Johnson, director of development for Sprint’s Velocity Program. “We have been testing IBM MessageSight for some initial projects and are excited about the capabilities that it could help us deliver to the vehicle and beyond.”

Foundational to IBM MessageSight is its support of MQTT, which was recently proposed to become an OASIS standard, providing a lightweight messaging transport for communication in machine to machine (M2M) and mobile environments. Sensors are often small in size, have low power and typically low communications bandwidth capabilities. MQTT can be used in conjunction with these devices. Its low power consumption, high performance and reliability allow real time updates that can be acted upon immediately.

IBM's MobileFirst platform is the first in the industry to speed the process of building apps by enabling companies to seamlessly integrate analytics and capture the complete on-device experience of how customers are using apps, including insight into gestures, dwell time and navigation.
