<p>I normally use vi as my favorite text editor. This can be in terminal or in
MacVIM. But because I looked for a good editor with mutli OS support I tried
Atom. And I was suprised I really liked the workflow and sepecially the Markdown
Support. I know there is a vi on Windows but the compatibility of your setup is
limited.</p>

<p>So I looked in the internet for interesting article about transitioning from vi
to atom. And found the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>http://edsko.net/2015/03/07/vim-to-atom/</li>
<li>http://blog.blakesimpson.co.uk/read/84-getting-started-with-the-atom-editor-and-tips-for-switching-from-vim-</li>
<li>http://felixjung.io/blog/2014/12/20/atom-form-a-vim-user/</li>
</ul>

<p>And an intersting article why this is not a good idea:</p>

<ul>
<li>http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2727fg/why_atom_cant_replace_vim_learning_the_lesson_of/</li>
<li>https://pascalprecht.github.io/2014/03/18/why-i-use-vim/</li>
</ul>

<p>I will continue to let your participate in my journey. I will still open my vi
especially if I am in Terminal. But for I hope to find a good replacement for my
MacVIM.</p>

<p>To be continued ...</p>
