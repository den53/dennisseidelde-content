I found a nice <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrie_4.0" target="_blank">Industrie 4.0</a> Smarter Industry Use Cases from <a href="http://www.abb.com/us" target="_blank">ABB</a>. Their 3D KPI solution for 800xA supports plant operations and stakeholders in making the right decisions. The 3D KPI visualizes a plant's key performance indicators together with ERP information in real time multi-touch display environment. Everything from economic performance to production efficiency and quality values are available in a virtual 3D model of the plant. ABB claims the following benefits:
<ul>
	<li>Accessible information anytime</li>
	<li>Save time with automatic data collection</li>
	<li>Improved collaboration at all levels</li>
</ul>
See for yourself and access how useful this is. I think this is a nice tool. But it is not an Industrie 4.0 Solution as ABB claims. It can only be part of an Industrie 4.0 Solution. Next week I will discuss with you what actually is needed for an Industrie 4.0 / Smarter Industry Solution.
