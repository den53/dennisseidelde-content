The hub will control Z-Wave as well as WiFi devices, meaning it'll work with third-party alarms, detectors and cameras on top of existing D-Link WiFi cameras and accessories. There's no word on pricing or availability yet but it looks like an interesting option for folks torn between cheaper WiFi and mainstream Z-Wave systems.

Bottom Line: Given that more and more products support either the Z-Wave or the Zigbee standard such hub devices provide a additional benefit. For a comparison Z-Wave vs Zigbee look <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2014/12/a-beginners-guide-to-home-automation-standards-z-wave-vs-zigbee/">here</a>.
