<p>Google has launched its <a href="http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/hello-places-api-for-android-and-ios.html">Places API for Android</a> and opened a beta program for it on iOS today. It will allow developers to add better location pickers to their apps, so users can specify where they are with real place names instead of latitudes and longitudes.</p>

<p>In addition, it also allows users to add new places to Google’s database of more than 100 million locations.</p>

<p>Google’s Places API and associated <a href="https://developers.google.com/places/">JavaScript library</a> has been available for Web apps for some time now, but the new APIs will help developers easily add their functionality into native mobile apps.</p>

<p>You can hop over to this Google Developers site to find documentation, code samples and demos for the <a href="https://developers.google.com/places/android/">Android API</a>, or sign up for iOS public beta on <a href="https://developers.google.com/places/ios/">this page</a>.</p>
