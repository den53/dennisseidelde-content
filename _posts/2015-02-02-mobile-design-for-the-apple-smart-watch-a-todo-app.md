Apple gave Developers the chance to and guidelines to have their app ready for the Apple Watch. This show how Apple wants their Smart Watch App to look like. In this case Todoist developed almost a complete version of their todo app witch follower the apple guidelines:

[blockquote author="Apple" link="http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/02/heres-how-a-to-do-app-will-work-on-the-apple-watch/?ncid=rss" style="" target="_blank"]The apps themselves should not be very complicated or feature-heavy. Instead, they should focus on conveying the most, and most relevant information possible given the limited screen real estate, and for a to-do app, it makes sense that those limits would result in a lot of nested lists.[/blockquote]

I think this is a good advice and will consider this for my own smart watch apps either for iOS or Android.
