Big Data makes privacy a difficult issue. Today we have the capabilities to store and analyse almost every data from your browsing behaviour to your shopping patterns or your GPS location. When we connect all this data sources and correlate and analyse them, this creates an troubling transparency. But the most critical problem is we often can not decide if we want to give away the data or not because it is unknown what data our government or a company uses and analysis. If this is known we first can check if the data that is collected about us is right and second we can adapt our behaviour and therefor shield information. This has always been this way. You perfectly fine wearing only underwear in your home because you expect privacy and that this behaviour does not  disturb anybody. But today we often do do not known that other people can practically what us in our living room. This tricks us in behaviour that relies on wrong assumption.

<a href="http://www.digitopoly.org/2013/08/21/what-to-do-about-data-and-privacy/?utm_source=feedly">Digitopoly.org</a> describes this from another angel: Put simply, I can imagine regulations that may prevent big companies like Google and Facebook from doing certain things but it also seems to me that so much data is being gathered that a regulation on one set of firms only raises the commercial opportunities for other firms outside of the domain of regulators — legally or otherwise. Personally, it wouldn’t worry me as much if it was used as an anonymous point in a big dataset — although I’d worry about the quality of data in that case. Google allows us to see — in a limited but important way — the information they are using to throw ads at us. As I use Chrome and permit this, Google has lots of information this way and I personally don’t mind them using it to get me more relevant ads. But when I looked at this recently, I saw that Google had decided I was interested in boxing, Brazilian music and Android Apps. Fortunately, Google also provided a way to change these assumptions which I did. What if ‘assumptions’ data like this that a company used in a formula to base a price or service to you was required to be transparent? This wouldn’t require a company to reveal the formula but it would require them to reveal any assumptions they are making and allow you to challenge them on the basis of accuracy. To be sure, this wouldn’t prevent information about yourself being used against you but it would be a first step in ensuring that, at the very least, the assumptions are accurate

Basiclly the solution to the privacy problem is the same. We (the consumer) need more information, so we need our own consumer big data system that help us analysis the companies.
