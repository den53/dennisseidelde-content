1. Download a Frontend HTML Template at [initializer.com](http://www.initializr.com/)
2. Go and download and setup SASS: [sass-lang.com](http://sass-lang.com/install)
3. Learn it: [sass-lang.com](http://sass-lang.com/guide)

UPDATE: I brought in about 1-2 hours myself up to speed with [Rapid SASS [Video] by Brock Nunn](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/rapid-sass-video). If you are interested in the example code you can find it here [packtpub.com/books/content/support](https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/support). Just enter the name of the course and select a delivery type. What I have learn will be add another time.
